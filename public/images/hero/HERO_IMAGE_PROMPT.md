In the center, a person in professional attire (seen from behind or side profile) is presenting on a large, semi-transparent holographic display showing glowing yellow and white data visualizations, circuit patterns, and code-like elements. The holographic screen displays KPIs, bar charts, line graphs, and a world map with yellow glowing connections, matching the Sofenter logo's circuit board aesthetic. Behind the presenter, three business professionals are seated at a dark conference table, silhouetted against subtle ambient lighting.
